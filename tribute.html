                <h3>About The Legend</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
                        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

                        Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles,
                        which helped earn him the nickname <strong> “Missile Man.”</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Among those successes was Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
                        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
